# VortexStrike

**VortexStrike** is a powerful security tool designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Apache 2.4.41, particularly focusing on Remote Code Execution (RCE) and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. This tool is intended for security researchers and penetration testers who want to assess the security posture of Apache web servers.

## Features

- **Apache Version Detection**: Detects the Apache version from the headers and body of HTTP responses to identify vulnerable installations.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: Executes RCE exploits through crafted payloads to gain unauthorized access to the server.
- **Reverse Shell**: Facilitates establishing a reverse shell connection to the target machine via RCE.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Launches DoS attacks to overload the server with requests, rendering it unresponsive.
